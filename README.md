# Project2

link: http://hidden-castle-32333.herokuapp.com/user

This a group project done by Alan Wagner, Wyatt Reiman, Kevin Motanya, Lydia Nyagitari.

The application is set up similar to Twitch wherin the user gets to view a live stream and chat about what is happening. The difference is that the live stream is a live feed of user submitted pictures. 

This application used the mvc format.

The libraries used were JavaScript, jQuery, mySQL, Sequelize, Handlebars, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, Express.js, Node.js.

The main challenges were getting the pictures to corresponde with sever time so as they are visible from all users screens simultaneously.
Other challenges included getting usernames to correspond with the correct user in the chat and getting the username to stick under the title of the picture.
